# Changelog

## 2.1.4 - 2026-10-07

- Put Usage options before Information, with a compact preview above the resource title; preserve the regular Information preview/title layout.
- Move Picker maximize into the browser action toolbar using the dashboard button style.
- Harden maximized dialog dimensions against template CSS overrides and preserve size preferences without an external button.

## 2.1.3 - 2026-10-07

- Keep the resource preview and provider preview actions in the Information view, leaving Usage options unobstructed.
- Add Picker maximize/restore with an independent remembered preference and shared host-page scroll locking.

## 2.1.2 - 2026-10-07

- Fit frontend modal editors to their available viewport and keep scrolling inside editor content, including accordion layouts.
- Lock same-origin host page scrolling while an editor modal is maximized; restore it on resize, close, or teardown.
- Route authorised Joomla media/article editor buttons through SmartBrowser when their integrations are enabled. Media insertion consumes image usage options and PDF thumbnail references.

## 2.1.1 - 2026-10-07

- Added explicit `presentation: 'hidden'` selection-profile options, including required properties with initial/default values.
- Hidden properties retain validation and result values without rendering editors or forcing an empty Info pane.
- Invalid hidden values produce a visible integration/profile configuration error.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-10-07

### Selection Profiles
- Added generic resource selection capabilities, caller selection profiles and per-resource usage state to the existing Picker.
- Added text, textarea, boolean, select, number and resource-reference editors in the existing Info pane, with primary/secondary presentation and validation.
- Added custom usage-editor and preview-action registration APIs.
- Added image alternative text, decorative state and loading strategy capabilities to the Media adapter.
- Added PDF thumbnail overrides using a nested instance of the same Picker, returning only a normalized resource reference.
- Preserved legacy result shapes; callers can explicitly request `{ selection, usage }`.
- Added ordered initial selections, isolated nested/parallel instances and transient Info visibility without changing remembered browser preferences.
- Added regression coverage, including desktop/mobile browser scenarios with the production renderer.

### Previously Uncommitted Changes
The source history also includes the changes delivered in the preserved 2.0.6 installer:
- Reusable single-adapter Collection View with resource resolution, ordering, removal, callbacks and lifecycle support.
- Flexible resource appearance rules, unified Font Awesome icon vocabulary and per-adapter icon customization.
- Generic SmartVisuals decoration consumption and optional SmartCrop image presentation.
- Expanded editor image-fieldset rendering for plugin fields, generic article creation defaults and the fix for normal creation without defaults.
- Default edit/selection actions, content previews, tree/breadcrumb icon fixes and Joomla media-field integration improvements.
- Remembered dashboard expansion and two-state popup editor maximization, with a shared dimmed/blurred modal backdrop.

### Verification
- 291 JavaScript tests and the standalone PHP regression suite pass locally.
- Browser checks cover image usage validation, PDF thumbnail selection/change/removal, ordered multiple selection, custom editors/actions and mobile layout.

## 2.0.6 - Archived Installer

The installer produced before Selection Profiles has been preserved as a separate
GitHub release under `archive-v2.0.6`.

The original full source snapshot was not committed. The archive tag therefore
contains only archival documentation and the installer checksum; it does not
pretend to be a reproducible source checkout of 2.0.6. Use the attached
`pkg_smartbrowser-v2.0.6.zip` installer, not GitHub's automatic source archives.
